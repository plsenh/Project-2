## About TamaFit:

TamaFit is a full stack web application that tracks a user's workout history and display an avatar of their choice. Users can view/edit their logs, update their avatars, and compare their exercise logs with other users' logs.

## Why this app?

TamaFit was written to address the problem of how a web-based fitness app could store user data in a relational database, display user data, allow the user to update their workouts and profiles, and display a ranking of users. TamaFit needed to be mobile-responsive as well.

## Technical Solutions:

Sequelize was used to manage the user input to a MySQL server. During testing, the database was hosted locally using MAMP, and it was pushed to Heroku for deployment, with JawsDB providing the SQL database. Bcrypt & passport provided authentication functionality. In addition, Handlebars was used for displaying the content onscreen, along with Bootstrap elements such as forms, buttons, and an image carousel. Media queries and Bootstrap classes were used for mobile responsiveness.
